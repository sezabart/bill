# Project Brief: Bill

## Overview
'Bill' is a system designed to streamline the process of creating internal bills for users of the FabLab. It aims to simplify the billing process for materials such as 3D filament, sheets of acrylic, and wood. Users will generate bills that can be taken to the store for payment.

## Objectives
- **Consistency**: Ensure all bills are generated with a standardized format.
- **Speed**: Reduce the time required to create and process bills.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplify the user interface to make bill creation intuitive.
- **Integration**: Connect with printers to automatically retrieve filament type and quantity used. This information is quickly lost by the user and often not gathered at the right time.

## Features
- **Standardized Billing Format**: All bills will follow a consistent template to avoid discrepancies.
- **Quick Bill Generation**: Users can create bills quickly with minimal input.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system will have an easy-to-navigate interface for all users.
- **Printer Integration**: Automatically fetch data from printers regarding filament type and quantity used, reducing manual entry errors.

## Benefits
- **Improved Accuracy**: Minimize errors in billing by automating data retrieval from printers.
- **Time Efficiency**: Speed up the billing process, allowing users and mentors to focus on their projects.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: A straightforward interface will make the system accessible to all users.

# Subprojects
## Selfie machine
Use a little camera, display and button to let people take a selfie, which gets printed out with a Center ROG border.

## Printer Status RGB
Use the printer status that will already be collected for filament and use the status value to drive a strip of WS2811 LED's above the printers. Green for available, orange for attention, etc etc.
